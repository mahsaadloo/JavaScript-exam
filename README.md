# Functions with buttons

In this project we have a input and 3 buttons. user enter a 5 digit number in the input and then press button randomNumber to get value and save it to a variable. when user press button give primeNumber, it calls funtion to calculate prime numbers until their number and appears in console. and when they press button clear, 2 arrays will be empty and alert under button that data is been deleted. and when user click on close button, all data will be deleted.
Then I add validation to prevent user to enter anything except numbers.
Finally I modulated my project.
