# 3 button functions for exam

As an exam context,when user push button(randomNumber) it appears a random number in the input and then save to use it for other buttons.(I know input is only for enter something and it is not output for showing something!) For this part I use Event and create a new object in an array to when I click randomNumber button, it gives a user a 5 digit random number with Math.floor(Math.random()*100000+1) and it appears in input.Then when user click Give prime Numbers, with a function showPrime() it gives a prime numbers until the random number. And I push them to an array and show it in console.For last part when user click clear data button with .pop() and .splice() method random number and prime number will be empty also I put clear button type as a submit button to clear input data infront of user !
Then I modular my project.
